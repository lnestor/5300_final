# Physics 5300 Final Problem Set

## Problem 1
a) Make a notebook that solves the double pendulum using (11.37) and
(11.38) in Taylor Section 11.4 (i.e., do not assume the small angle approximation).
Implement the pendulum code as a Python class (as in our examples).
__You can use either the Euler-Lagrange or Hamiltonian equations.__
The basic output will be plots of the two angles as a function of time for given initial conditions.

b) Show that the system is chaotic for initial conditions beyond the small angle approximation.

c) Add Markdown/LaTeX documentation.

d) Extend your simulation to three pendulums.

e) Add widgets to control the simulation and/or animate it.

## Problem 2

a) Make a notebook that solves the two-body problem for gravitational
attraction between two bodies (e.g., earth and sun) in Cartesian coordinates. Implement the differential equation code as a Python class (as in our examples).

b) Show that the problem reduces to the orbits considered in class if one of the bodies is very heavy and you are in its rest frame.

c) Add Markdown/LaTeX documentation.

d) Use the Leapfrog method to solve the differential equations and show
that it conserves energy while using the SciPy ODE solvers do not.

e) Extend the simulation to three bodies (i.e., add a planet) in the same plane and comment on the orbits you find.

f) Add widgets to control the simulation and/or animate the orbits.
