# How to navigate this repository

I split the final project into several different notebooks, so look here for what each of them contain.

## Double Pendulum

- Double_Pendulum.ipynb

This contains the basic double pendulum class and plots of different orbits.

- Double_Pendulum_Animation.ipynb

This animates a couple different pendulums (notice the trails behind the masses!).

- Triple_Pendulum.ipynb

Solves the equations of motion for a triple pendulum and plots a few.

- Triple_Pendulum_Animation.ipynb

Animates two different triple pendulums.

## Gravitational Orbits

- Gravitational_Orbits.ipynb

Solves the Lagrangian equations of motion for two body orbits and plots a few.

- Gravitational_Orbits_Animation.ipynb

As it says, animates a few different two body orbits (no trails behind the masses this time :( ).

- Gravitational_Orbits_Leapfrog.ipynb

Implements the leapfrog algorithm for orbits. Didn't really get to check conservation of energy,
I spent too much time on Bezier curves.

- Triple_Orbits.ipynb

Solves the equations of motion for three bodies in the same plane and plots two. No animations for
this one because, let's be real, watching masses move in an orbit isn't nearly as exciting as
Bezier curves.

## Bezier Curves

I wanted a change of pace from orbits one day so I made some pretty neat curves. Not a part of the project
at all, but really cool to look at.
